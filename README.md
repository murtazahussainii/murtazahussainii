Recent Computer Engineering graduate from York University, now pursuing a Master of Engineering in Software Engineering at Ontario Tech University. I enjoy building full-stack applications and solving technical challenges from the ground up.

Skilled in JavaScript, Java, C, Python, with growing experience in React, Spring Boot, and CI/CD workflows. Always open to collaborating on real-world projects or contributing to open-source tools.

When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me on the soccer field or exploring new cafes.
