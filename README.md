I’m Murtaza Hussaini, a recent graduate in Computer Engineering from York University, currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Software Engineering at Ontario Tech University. My focus lies in full-stack development and system-level problem solving.

I’m passionate about building scalable and efficient solutions from scratch, combining solid backend logic with clean, intuitive front-end design. I have hands-on experience with JavaScript, Java, C, and Python, and I’m currently expanding my knowledge in React, Spring Boot, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized deployments.
